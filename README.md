An exclusive financial insights dashboard in development, demonstrating basic literacy in architecting development to deployment. This repository is pulled to a Digital Ocean droplet with basic root & firewall security, utilizing Caddy for reverse-proxying http requests to Docker Containers which spin up a React Frontend, a Django Backend, a Postgres Database, and PgAdmin for a browser-based interface for database explorations. Current features deployed include registering a user, authenticating logins utilizing access & refresh tokens, and an API call for outsourced data such as the FED interest rate. Pending improvements are live form feedback, a more polished drop-down menu, finessing responsive design, and fortifying the overall code to embody more secure practices in sharing code publicly.
